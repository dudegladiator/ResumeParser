The IPv6 address\nspace reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing\nby border routers at network edges.\n• Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6\naddresses to individual router interfaces.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un

Then combine time features and user features together to construct my entire feature\nset.\nI decided not to use LSTM to tackle as the problem, due to the features by user are more speci�c than by\ntime, and GPS records are too many mistakes so that they can't present the pattern of user completely,\nlike user X is staying around Y area in the previous minute, then the next few minute's record shows that it\nmove to the hundred kilometers away from Y. Furthermore the training result of machine learning also\ndisplays that it's more accurate than LSTM.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-tseng\nhttps://github.com/samuelTyh\nmailto:samueltseng@icloud.com\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154SteEVVW3a8lPWfY9S5MnUdn2HSYzH_jm0Km8_wNFs/edit#slide=id.p\nhttps://github.com/dspim/BenQ-R-Workshop/blob/master/README.md\n\n\nFeb 2018 Trend Micro   Malware Detection competition \n\nThe raw data have only 4 columns, and I have to create a model to predict about 30 thousands targets.

Then combine time\nfeatures and user features together to construct my entire feature set.\nI decided not to use LSTM to tackle as the problem, due to the features by user are more speci�c than by\ntime, and GPS records are too many mistakes so that they can't present the pattern of user completely,\nlike user X is staying around Y area in the previous minute, then the next few minute's record shows that it\nmove to the hundred kilometers away from Y. Furthermore the training result of machine learning also\ndisplays that it's more accurate than LSTM.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tacoyakii\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-tseng\nhttps://github.com/\nmailto:samueltseng@icloud.com\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/BqFHTn6KMKiQp82Z8\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=154SteEVVW3a8lPWfY9S5MnUdn2HSYzH_jm0Km8_wNFs\nhttps://github.com/dspim/BenQ-R-Workshop/blob/master/README.md\n\n\n \n2018/2 Trend Micro   Malware Detection competition  \n\nPrivate Leaderboard Score - 93.6878(metrics: AUC) \nPrivate Leaderboard Ranking - 65/424\n\nPostgraduate, 29 Jan 2018 - 30 Apr 2018\n\nTaiwan AI Academy ( http://aiacademy.tw/ ) was founded by Dr. Sheng-Wei Chen (\nhttp://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~swc/index.html), Chairman of Taiwan Data Science Foundation.\n\n \nFinal-term project: Human-Object-Interaction Detection(based on Learning to Detect Human-Object\nInteractions by Yu-Wei Chao, Yunfan Liu, Xieyang Liu, Huayi Zeng, Jia Deng) \n\nProject's slide: https://bit.ly/2tLkWjY\n\nSpecialist, 04 May 2015 - 31 May 2017\n\nSales Representative of Corporate Financial in Taipei City. \n1.
